  <p>The Polyfen Group LLC is a small holding company that owns and operates a portfolio of brands with the common goal to explore new ways of using technology in creative projects.</p>
  <p>The company was founded in 2018 by <a href="https://boris.hr" target="_blank">Boris Hrn&ccaron;i&cacute;</a> &mdash;Argentinian-Croatian, art director and product designer&mdash; with the support of a few colleagues sharing the same passion for building something we can be proud of.</p>
